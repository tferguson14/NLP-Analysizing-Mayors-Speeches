# NLP-Analysizing-Mayors-Speeches

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze mayors’ speeches from cities around the United States to identify local policy trends. The goal would be to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify policy topics in mayor’s speeches. The dataset consists of about 150 speeches per year and is between the years 2016-2019. The first objective of this project is to use LDA to create a topic model to represent the distribution of topics across the full dataset. Once the overall distribution of policy topics is obtained, it will be further segmented by year and region and the similarities and differences in the distribution of the topics will be analyzed.

## Background
This project idea emerged from an annual report called “States of the Cities” from the National League of Cities (NLC). Two of our group members, Cristina and Taisha, are employees at the NLC. For the State of the Cities report, NLC staff members have been manually tagging policy topics in mayor’s speeches to analyze emerging policy trends. We intend to help improve the efficiency of the NLC staff’s tagging process with the use of NLP topic models.

## Data
It is worth mentioning that the speeches comprising the State of the City report are speeches given once a year by the local mayors of many cities in the United States. In these documents, mayors detail problems that are shaped by the local realities, as well as their vision and willingness to solve these problems. For the purpose of this project, we considered 150 speeches per year, between 2016 and 2019. These documents come in two formats: WORD and PDF files. Ultimately, these documents don’t have a uniform structure or a standard format (for instance, a document can have purely a text content, while others might include pictures).
